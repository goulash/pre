This file checks whether certain comments are ignored.

// This C++ comment should be stripped.

When the above comment is stripped, the end-of-line should not
be stripped with it. (Too bad, because this would make the
mplementation particularly elegant.) While this would be
acceptable (even desirable) for entire-line comments, it
would be problematic for code like this:

    int i = 4 // magic number
    *p.next

So how do C comments fare?

    int main(int /*argc*/, char ** /*argv*/) {
        return 0;
    }
